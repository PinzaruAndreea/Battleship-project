# Battleship-project
I imported an important library for the placement of the battleship: random (randint-random integer).  The board table was created by appending in a range of 5, 5 times of the string "o"
I further defined five functions with the help of the imported library to set up the game. I nested a few statements in a for loop to decide what happens when a player gets the right spot of the battleship.
A message will show if a person gets the shot right/misses it.
